Build a React frontend for a "Smart Health Care Management System" with the following:

Tech stack:
- React (functional components, hooks)
- React Router (for navigation)
- TailwindCSS (for styling, modern responsive UI)
- Axios (for API calls to backend)
- Socket.IO client (for real-time chat)
- WebRTC integration (or placeholder) for video call

Pages:
1. **Login & Signup Page**
   - Allow login/signup for patients, doctors, and admin
   - Form with email, password, role (dropdown)
   - Store JWT token in localStorage

2. **Patient Dashboard**
   - Show upcoming appointments
   - Button to "Book Appointment"
   - Sidebar navigation: Dashboard | Doctors | Chat | Video Call | Profile

3. **Doctor Dashboard**
   - Show today’s appointments
   - List of patients with "Start Chat" or "Start Video Call"
   - Sidebar navigation

4. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Manage doctors and users
   - Simple table with add/remove doctor

5. **Doctor List Page**

- Admin manages doctors

Deliverables:
