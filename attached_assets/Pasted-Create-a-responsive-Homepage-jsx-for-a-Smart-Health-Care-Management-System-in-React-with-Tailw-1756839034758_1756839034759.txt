Create a responsive **Homepage.jsx** for a "Smart Health Care Management System" in React with TailwindCSS. No backend required — use mock data and placeholders. The homepage should include:

1. **Navbar (top)**
   - Logo on left ("Smart Health Care")
   - Links: Home, Doctors, Appointments, Contact
   - Right side: Login / Signup buttons
   - Responsive with hamburger menu on mobile

2. **Hero Section**
   - Big heading: "Consult Doctors Anytime, Anywhere"
   - Subheading: "Book appointments, chat, or video call with certified doctors instantly."
   - Two buttons: "Find Doctors" (link to /doctors) and "Book Appointment" (link to /appointments/book)
   - Right side placeholder image (gray box with text "Hero Image")

3. **Features Section (3–4 cards)**
   - Cards with icon + title + short description:
     - Video Consultations
     - Instant Chat
     - Easy Appointment Booking
     - Secure Medical Records

4. **How It Works Section (3 steps)**
   - Step 1: Find a doctor
   - Step 2: Book slot or start chat
   - Step 3: Consult & get prescription
   - Show steps in horizontal layout (stacked on mobile)

5. **Featured Doctors Section**
   - Grid of 3–4 doctor cards (mock data)
   - Each card: Doctor name, specialty, rating ★★★★☆, "Book" button

6. **Testimonials Section**
   - 2–3 testimonials (mock data)
   - Card with avatar placeholder, name, feedback text

7. **Call-to-Action Section**
   - Full-width colored strip: "Start your healthcare journey today!"
   - Button: "Sign Up Now" → /signup

8. **Footer**
   - Links: About, Contact, Privacy Policy
   - Social icons placeholders
   - Copyright text

Styling:
- Use Tailwind classes with a healthcare theme (blue/green shades).
- Rounded cards, shadows, responsive layout.
- Mobile-friendly (stack sections vertically).
